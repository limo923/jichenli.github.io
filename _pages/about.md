CFCS, Computer Science Department, Peking University, Beijing, China.

I am a fifth-year PhD student at Peking University, supervised by Prof. [Xiaotie Deng](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/xiaotiedeng/index.htm). I am expected to obtain my doctoral degree in July next year. I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree from the Department of Computer Science at Peking University.

My current research focuses on blockchain, specifically on game-theoretic design and solving security problems in distributed systems. I am dedicated to analyzing the economic security of existing blockchain protocols using techniques such as game theory, algorithm analysis, and reinforcement learning. I also employ mechanism design and applied cryptography to develop new protocols. For example, I am now particularly interested in analyzing and addressing issues such as selfish mining in Ethereum, the MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) problem, and transaction fee mechanism design.

During my Ph.D. studies, I was a visiting researcher in Prof. [Bin Xiao](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csbxiao/)'s group at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University from January 2023 to May 2023.
